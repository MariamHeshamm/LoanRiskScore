# LoanRiskScore
The aim of this project is to predict loan credit risk and determine the probability of non-payment of bank financial services (e.g., whether a person will pay back a loan or not). By using scoring models that are AI-based and use deep learning, 
banks and financial institutions can access more realistic predictions on credit risk, using customersâ€™ credit history and the power of big data. This way credit can be approved to the right people and better pricing options offered to people who 
deserve it,also Classify a loan into one of seven categories: {A, AA, B, C, D, E or HR} based 
on the provided features .
